## Target audience

EverBEEN is a project for developers, testers, software project leaders and researchers who are looking for a way to automate benchmarking and testing. To these people, EverBEEN can provide an environment that can be easily deployed into a heterogeneous network and that can ease the task of creating, debugging, running and managing benchmarks, especially those aimed at evaluating distributed systems and middleware.

What BEEN is *not*:

* BEEN is not a benchmark, nor will it by itself perform any actual benchmarking.

* BEEN is not a standalone desktop application, you will have to provide or write your own tasks and benchmarks.

To be able to use BEEN, users are expected to be experienced in the area of software benchmarking and performance testing. Users should already know what exactly they want to benchmark, how they are going to benchmark it and what the outcome of their benchmarks should be. They should know how to interpret and evaluate the resulting data and be able to understand what the benchmark measured and whether the output makes sense.

Users should also have a decent knowledge about general benchmarking practices, possible problems, and various factors that can influence the validity of results. This is especially required for regression benchmarking, where the consequences of a wrong choice of metrics or data misinterpretation are amplified by the direct projection of benchmarking conclusions on the development process.
