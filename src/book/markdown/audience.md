## Target audience

BEEN is a project for developers, testers, software project leaders and researchers, who are looking for a way to automate benchmarking and testing, especially for middleware benchmarking and distributed systems testing. To these people BEEN can provide an environment that can be easily deployed into a heterogeneous network and that can ease the task of creating, debugging, running and managing benchmarks.

What BEEN is *not*:

* BEEN is not a benchmark, nor will it by itself perform any actual benchmarking.

* BEEN is not a standalone desktop application, you will have to provide or write your own tasks and benchmarks. Although BEEN comes with a few example benchmarks that will demonstrate its capabilities.

* BEEN is not a service, instead it is a software that users have to deploy.

To be able to use BEEN, users are expected to be knowledged in the area of software benchmarking and performance testing. Users should already know, what exactly they want to benchmark, how are they going to benchmark it and what data should be the outcome of their benchmarks. They should know how to interpret and evaluate the data and be able to understand what the benchmark measured and whether the data is correct.

Users should also have a decent knowledge about general benchmarking practices, possible problems, how to plan benchmarks and what factor can influence the validity of results. This is especially required for regression benchmarking, where bias could easily lead to wrong interpretation of the data.

If you are a developer of the software you want to benchmark, your situation is both easier and harder -- easier in the sense that you probably already know what you want to benchmark and how to do it, and harder because your position when interpreting the data might not be neutral. BEEN will not help you evaluate your data, but it will provide an environment where distributed benchmarking can be done much easier.

You are also expected to understand how to present the gathered and evaluated data to a wider audience and how to avoid biasing or misrepresenting the results. This can happen very easily when comparing competing product -- it's always important to understand what exactly are you benchmarking and what issues are involved.
