## Design goals
* scalability
* * decentralize decision-making
* * use a non-SPOF comm protocol (replacing TM and RMI)
* genericity (in reaction to previous experience with RR)
* * provide extension points
* * resulting abstraction
* * dynamic implementation loading
* ease of use
* * heavy Maven integration into Task API (BPK plugin), subsequent Java task focus
* * node service composition over separate processes
