## EverBEEN architecture
* mostly true to the original BEEN
* * principal components stayed the same (SWRepository, RRepository, HostRuntimes)
* * Tasks are still separate processes
* * Put some cool pictures and thesis links here
* cluster adaptation
* * TaskManager ascended to hive-mind
* * SWRepository emits its location to the cluster
* * RRepository is not centralized anymore (can run on multiple nodes if need be)
