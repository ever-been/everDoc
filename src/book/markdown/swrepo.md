## BPKs and Software repository {#user.swrepository}

### Been package (BPK) {#user.swrepository.bpk}
Been package, shortly BPK, contains binaries and descriptors needed to run tasks, task contexts and benchmarks.
Each package has its own unique identifier structured in a way resembling identifiers used by Maven. The identifier consists of three parts: 

1. **Group ID** --- A universally unique identifier for a BPK. It is a good practice to use a fully-qualified package name to distinguish it from other BPK packages with a similar name (eg. cz.been.example).
2. **Bpk ID** --- The identifier of the BPK that is unique within the group given by the group ID.
3. **Version** --- The current version of the BPK.

BPK package is represented by a single file with a **\*.bpk** suffix. In fact the bpk file is a zip file with a predefined structure described below.

    package.bpk
       \___ config.xml
       \___ files/
       \___ lib/
       \___ tcds/
       \___ tds/


1. ***config.xml*** file --- Main configuration of the BPK. It consists of two main sections:
    - **metaInf** section --- specifies unique identifier of the BPK. 
    - **runtime** section --- specifies runtime type. Been supports two runtime types - **JavaRuntime** and **NativeRuntime**. 
        - **JavaRuntime** --- defines tasks written in JVM based language (e.g. Java, Scala, Groovy). The name of the jar with the implementation is required.
        - **NativeRuntime** --- defines tasks written in other languages. This type requires the name of the executable to be used.

    Following examples show valid descriptors for *java* and *native* runtimes.

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
<ns2:bpkConfiguration xmlns:ns2="http://been.d3s.mff.cuni.cz/bpk/config">

    <ns2:metaInf>
        <groupId>fully-quallified.group.id</groupId>
        <bpkId>bpkId</bpkId>
        <version>3.0.0-EXAMPLE-ALPHA</version>
    </ns2:metaInf>
    
    <ns2:runtime xsi:type="ns2:JavaRuntime"
            xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">
        <jarFile>packed_jar_with_tasks.jar</jarFile>
    </ns2:runtime>
    
</ns2:bpkConfiguration>
```


```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
<ns2:bpkConfiguration xmlns:ns2="http://been.d3s.mff.cuni.cz/bpk/config">

    <ns2:metaInf>
        <groupId>fully-quallified.group.id</groupId>
        <bpkId>bpkId</bpkId>
        <version>3.0.0-EXAMPLE-ALPHA</version>
    </ns2:metaInf>
    
    <ns2:runtime xsi:type="ns2:NativeRuntime"
            xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">
        <binary>name_of_executable</binary>
    </ns2:runtime>
            
</ns2:bpkConfiguration>
```

2. ***files/*** directory --- contains executable and library files. In the case of the ***JavaRuntime***  it must contain an appropriate .jar file, ***NativeRuntime*** must place its executable and library files there. 

3. ***lib/*** directory --- ***JavaRuntime***s can place additional jars which will be added to the `classpath` of a task once running on a Host Runtime. 

4. ***tcds/*** directory --- contains Task Context descriptors.

5. ***tds/*** directory --- must contain at least one Task descriptor.


When a task is started, *lib/*, *files*, *tds/* and *tcds/* directories are copied into the working directory of the task.

Even though it is possible to create a BPK "by hand", this is not recommended. The standard way of assembling a BPK file is to use the Been Bpk Plugin for Maven which does all the hard work.

**Note:** You can see additional XML elements (not mentioned above) in *context.xml* file generated by Been Bpk Plugin for Maven and you can also find definitions of these elements in corresponding \*.xsd file, but these elements are not used by the current version of EverBEEN. 


### Software repository {#user.swrepository.swrepository}
The main purpose of the software repository is to store BPKs for future use. The Software Repository is implemented as a service which can be started on an arbitrary EverBEEN node.

### BPK versioning {#user.swrepository.bpkversioning}
Software repository does not allow re-uploading of BPKs with the same `groupId`, `bpkId` and `version`. If you want to re-upload a BPK, you have to change its version. The reason for this limitation is simple --- it prevents inconsistencies and unpredictable behavior caused by version mismatches.

To facilitate the development of new tasks and benchmarks BPKs can be created with version suffixed by **'-SNAPSHOT'**. Such versions of BPKs can be re-uploaded to the Software Repository. Also Host Runtimes will download such versions instead of using cached packages. It is not recommended to use **'-SNAPSHOT'** in a production environment.
